##Conclusion.
#To conclude, the complexity of the models will increase further as more parameters and compartments are added. Incorporating age structure will introduce compartments and processes for each age group. Contact rates between age groups and gender may vary calling for further compartmentalisation.Vector borne diseases shall include separate but interacting compartments between and within host and vectors. However, the basic priciples/ framework shall remain the same. Also, from the existing data, caliberation of parameters such as reproduction number can be carried out using Maximum Log-Likelihood and other methods. Do we never have outbreaks when reproduction number is less than one (think stochastically)..and the journey continues.. Enjoy modelling! Thank You!!
