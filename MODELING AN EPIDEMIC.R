##MODELLING AN EPIDEMIC
##Why do we model epidemics?
#Predict the current conditions
#Predict future progress of any given epidemic
#Understand the mechanisms behind the epidemic
#Understand which interventions might be successful

##How do we model epidemics?
#Identify key biological processes
#Abstract them into a mathematical model
#Investigate effect(s) of changing parameters

## SI MODEL
#Assume
#fixed population of constant size (S+I=N)
#All members of the population are in contact

#Rate at which a susceptible person gets infected depends upon:
#The number or proportion of infected persons
#The transmission rate Î²

##Rate of infection
#We are going to focus on frequency dependent transmission
#This is the most appropriate for models in humans
#Livestock models may use density dependent transmission
